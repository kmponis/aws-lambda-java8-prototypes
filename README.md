An AWS Lambda project to implement Java8 prototypes


### Java 8 Lanbda Functions
* Use Function if it takes something, and returns something.
* Use BiFunction if it takes two(2) something, and returns something.
* Use 'Custom_Class' if it takes multiple(>2) something, and returns something.
* Use Supplier if it takes nothing, but returns something.
* Use Consumer if it takes something, but returns nothing.
* Use Callable if it returns a result and might throw (most akin to Thunk in general CS terms).
* Use Runnable if it does neither and cannot throw.
